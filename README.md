## üß† Project Design Overview

- **Model Objective**: Predict the binary classification ‚Äî *Will it rain tomorrow?*
- **Data Source**: Historical weather data of Australian cities.
- **Pipeline**:
  1. Preprocessing and training of a machine learning model.
  2. Exposing the prediction service via a Flask API.
  3. Containerizing the application using Docker.
  4. Deploying on Kubernetes.
  5. Automated testing & deployment via CircleCI.
